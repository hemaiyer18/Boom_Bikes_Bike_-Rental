## General Information
- Boom Bikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people to cater to the people's needs
- The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
- The company wants to know how well those variables describe the bike demands
- We will build a linear regression model to predict demand for bikes and use it on test data to predict the bike demand

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Count of total rental bikes (totalCount) in year 2019 is 24% higher than that in 2018

- In general demand or bikes increases year on year

- It increases with increase in temperature

- Demand is high in clear weather conditions and low in light snow and rain and zero in heavy rains with snowfall

- Weather conditions like humidity, windspeed, mist, snowfall and rains significantly affect company business

- Business increases by 0.3763 even in the absence of all other independent variables.
